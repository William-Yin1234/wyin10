NOTES:
-MacOS is a real greedy geezer and doesn't like python3 certificates. https://medium.com/@yen.hoang.1904/resolve-issue-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-when-trying-to-open-an-url-with-python-on-macos-46d868b44e10
-This was literally the only problem I had with getting the info from the site... MAC IS STILL 1000% THE SUPERIOR OS FITE ME.
-the info is a dictionary not a list
-have to deserialize it so that it's not a goopy bunch of json mess (https://realpython.com/python-json/)
