v1)
Prediction: Loads up a table. When each item in table is clicked, creates an alert with the text from the table element.

Outcome: Above


v2)
Prediction: Loads up a table. When each item in table is clicked, creates an alert with the text from the table element,
then creates an alert with all the text from the table row, and finally an alert with the text from the entire table.

Outcome: Above but includes all the html, including the tags


v3) Prediction: If e.stopPropagation is uncommented, then the event won't be passed down to the next functions. It would load up a table.
When each item in table is clicked, creates an alert with the text from the table element. (Same as v1) If it is commented, then it would
go in the same order as v2.


Outcome: When e.stopPropagation is commented, creates an alert for the entire table, then table element, then table row.
When e.stopPropagation is uncommented, only alerted with text from entire table. The useCapture parameter is set to true,
which makes the event "bubble up", however the stopPropagation function stops the same event from being called.


v4) Prediction: The order should not change from v3 because the event is always called from the outer most element regardless. If
stopPropagation is uncommented, then only the first alert loads.


Outcome: The order does not change if the order of the event listeners are changed. An alert is created for the table, then the row,
then the single table element. If stopPropagation is uncommented then only the first alert loads.
